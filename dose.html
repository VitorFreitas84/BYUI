            <h1 class="dontsplit">What is radiation dose?</h1>
            <p>A dose of medical radiation is not like a dose of medicine. When it comes to radiation dose, there are different types of and units of measurement. Radiation dose is a complicated topic.</p>
            <img id="hero-img" src="images/Radiation-Dose.png" alt="Radiation-Dose">
            <h2 class="dontsplit">Why are there different ways to measure a dose of radiation?</h2>
            <p>When you think of a dose of medication, you think of an absolute measurement of the quantity you take. But radiation isn't measured by the quantity you take.</p>
            <p>Radiation from medical examinations is similar to sunlight. The effect of sunlight on the skin depends on the light's intensity and how long a person stays in it.</p>

            <h3>Sunlight Effect Factors:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li class="dontsplit">Intensity</li>
                <li class="dontsplit">Length of exposure</li>
                <li class="dontsplit">Sensitivity of the skin</li>
            </ul>

            <p>People often describe their level of sun exposure based on the effect it has on their skin. Friends may say "You got a lot of sun." Or, "You're red; that must hurt." They are gauging the amount of sunlight, to which you were exposed, by what they see.</p>
            <p>Likewise, a radiation dose will tell us about an effect the radiation has on tissue. Radiation dose can be measured a number of ways.</p>

            <h4 class="dontsplit">Radiation Doses</h4>
            <p>What these different doses can tell us:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Absorbed dose</strong> is used to assess the potential for biochemical changes in specific tissues.</li>
                <li><strong>Equivalent dose</strong> is used to assess how much biological damage is expected from the absorbed dose. (Different types of radiation have different damaging properties.)</li>
                <li><strong>Effective dose</strong> is used to assess the potential for long-term effects that might occur in the future.</li>
            </ul>

            <h5>Definitions</h5>
            <p><strong>Absorbed dose</strong> is the concentration of energy deposited in tissue as a result of an exposure to ionizing radiation. Note: In this case, it means the energy absorbed by human tissue.</p>
            <p>X-rays, unlike sunlight, can penetrate deep into the body and deposit energy in internal organs. X-rays can even pass through a person's body.</p>
            <p>Absorbed dose describes the intensity of the energy deposited in any small amount of tissue located anywhere in the body.</p>
            <p>The unit of measurement for absorbed dose is the milligray (mGy).</p>
            <p>If you have a CT of your upper abdomen, the absorbed dose to your chest is very low because it has only been exposed to a small amount of scattered radiation. The absorbed dose to your stomach, pancreas, liver, and other organs is greatest because they have been directly exposed.</p>

            <p><strong>Definition 2</strong></p>
            <p><strong>Equivalent dose</strong> is an amount that takes the damaging properties of different types of radiation into account. (Not all radiation is alike.)</p>
            <p><em>Absorbed vs. equivalent dose</em></p>
            <p>The difference between absorbed dose in tissue and equivalent dose:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Absorbed dose tells us the energy deposit in a small volume of tissue.</li>
                <li>Equivalent dose addresses the impact that the type of radiation has on that tissue.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Because all radiation used in diagnostic medicine has the same low-harm potential, the absorbed dose and the equivalent dose are numerically the same. Only the units are different.</p>
            <p>For diagnostic radiation: The equivalent dose in milliSievert (mSv) = the absorbed dose in mGy.</p>

            <strong><em>Definition 3</em></strong>
            <p><strong>Effective dose</strong> is a calculated value, measured in mSv, that takes three factors into account:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>the absorbed dose to all organs of the body,</li>
                <li>the relative harm level of the radiation, and</li>
                <li>the sensitivities of each organ to radiation.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Effective dose: The quantity of effective dose helps us take into account sensitivity.</p>
            <div class="indentsm">
                <p>Different body parts have different sensitivities to radiation. For example, the head is less sensitive than the chest.</p>
                <p>Effective dose relates to the overall long-term risk to a person from a procedure and is useful for comparing risks from different procedures.</p>
                <p>Effective dose is not intended to apply to a specific patient.</p>
                <p>The actual risk to a patient might be higher or lower, depending on the size of the patient and the type of procedure.</p>
            </div>
            <p>Example of absorbed dose, equivalent dose, and effective dose. If you have a CT of the abdomen, what is the dose to the abdomen?</p>
            <ul>
                <li class="dontsplit">Typical absorbed dose: 20 mGy</li>
                <li class="dontsplit">Typical equivalent dose: 20 mSv</li>
                <li class="dontsplit">Typical effective dose: 15 mSv</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 class="dontsplit">What dose should be used to assess potential long-term risks from various procedures?</h3>
            <p>Absorbed dose and equivalent dose measurements can be used to assess short-term risk to tissues. (Short term is weeks to months.)</p>
            <p>For properly performed diagnostic examinations, there will be no short-term effects from the radiation exposure, so absorbed dose and equivalent dose are not very useful.</p>
            <p>For patients, the most important dose quantity is effective dose because it allows for simple comparisons of long-term risks.</p>
