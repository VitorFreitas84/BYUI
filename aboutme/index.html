        <h2>Vitor Hugo Santos Freitas</h2>  
        
        <p>Howdy ya'll. Let me introduce myself. I am divorced and have a 7-year-old daughter named Victoria. 
            I am from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil,
            It is always hot here, we say it is always summer, but it can be a wonderful and exciting place.</p> 
        <p>I am a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints at this time, when I was 1 year old, my parents met the elders and were taught and were baptized,
            this happened more than 38 years ago. The things I love about church are: Jesus
         Christ, prophets, etc.</p> 
         <p>I have a degree in Radiology Technologist and work at a university, teaching the principles of radiation to young university students. 
            I love my job. I really like the technology area, which is why I became interested in studying computer science.</p> 
             <p>I enjoy doing a lot of things. I welcome getting to know all of my classmates. </p>
             <p>I really like studying and learning new things, and I'm very excited for this semester.</p>
                <p>Thank you for looking at my web page.</p>
