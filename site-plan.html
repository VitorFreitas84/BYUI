      <h3>Types of Ionizing Radiation</h3>
      <p>
        Radiation
        
        What is Radiation? In physics, radiation is defined as energy that travels through space or matter in the form of a particle or wave. It can be produced in one of two ways: by radioactive decay of an unstable atom (radionuclide), or by the interaction of a particle with matter. Some attributes of radioactive decay are spontaneousness and randomness. The type of radiation emitted depend on the specific radionuclide. Radiation emission as the result of an interaction depends on both the incoming particle and the material it hits, and is theoretically predictable if enough information is known. Electromagnetic & Particulate Radiations Radiation is described by its type and energy. The types of radiation fall into two main categories: particulate and electromagnetic. electromagnetic radiation consists of photons that have energy, but no mass or charge, such as radio waves, microwaves, infrared, visible light, ultraviolet, x-rays, and gamma radiation (γ). A photon, as described by quantum theory, is a “particle” or “quantum” that contains a discrete quantity of electromagnetic energy which travels at a speed of light. particulate radiation consists of particles that have mass and energy, and may or may not have an electric charge, such as alpha radiation (α), beta radiation (β),proton radiation and neutron radiation. Those radiation type above will be discussed in next section in detail. The most common unit of energy used to describe radiation is the electronvolt(eV). An electronvolt is the amount of kinetic energy an electron gains when accelerated through a potential difference of one volt. The conversion to SI units is<mjx-container class="MathJax CtxtMenu_Attached_0" jax="CHTML" tabindex="0" ctxtmenu_counter="0" style="font-size: 118.4%; position: relative;"><mjx-math class="MJX-TEX" aria-hidden="true"><mjx-mn class="mjx-n"><mjx-c class="mjx-c31"></mjx-c></mjx-mn><mjx-mi class="mjx-i"><mjx-c class="mjx-c1D452 TEX-I"></mjx-c></mjx-mi><mjx-mi class="mjx-i"><mjx-c class="mjx-c1D449 TEX-I"></mjx-c></mjx-mi><mjx-mo class="mjx-n" space="4"><mjx-c class="mjx-c3D"></mjx-c></mjx-mo><mjx-mn class="mjx-n" space="4"><mjx-c class="mjx-c31"></mjx-c><mjx-c class="mjx-c2E"></mjx-c><mjx-c class="mjx-c36"></mjx-c></mjx-mn><mjx-mo class="mjx-n" space="3"><mjx-c class="mjx-c2217"></mjx-c></mjx-mo><mjx-msup space="3"><mjx-mn class="mjx-n"><mjx-c class="mjx-c31"></mjx-c><mjx-c class="mjx-c30"></mjx-c></mjx-mn><mjx-script style="vertical-align: 0.393em;"><mjx-texatom size="s" texclass="ORD"><mjx-mo class="mjx-n"><mjx-c class="mjx-c2212"></mjx-c></mjx-mo><mjx-mn class="mjx-n"><mjx-c class="mjx-c31"></mjx-c><mjx-c class="mjx-c39"></mjx-c></mjx-mn></mjx-texatom></mjx-script></mjx-msup></mjx-math><mjx-assistive-mml unselectable="on" display="inline"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mn>1</mn><mi>e</mi><mi>V</mi><mo>=</mo><mn>1.6</mn><mo>∗</mo><msup><mn>10</mn><mrow data-mjx-texclass="ORD"><mo>−</mo><mn>19</mn></mrow></msup></math></mjx-assistive-mml></mjx-container>

      <h3>Types of Radiation and Biological Effects</h3>
      <p>
        External exposure to α-particles does not cause problems because α-particles cannot penetrate the horny layer of the skin (layer of dead cells on the skin surface). However, internal exposure to any radioactive material that emits α-particles causes large amounts of local ionization, i.e., high-density ionization, within tissues, providing concentrated energy. This significantly damages DNA and has strong biological effects.  β-particles cause direct ionization of the substance it passes through, as do α-particles, but because of their low ionization density, their biological effects are not as strong as those of α-particles. External exposure to β-particles could affect the skin and subcutaneous tissues.  γ-rays and X-rays reach deep organs and tissues because of their strong penetrating power but do not have high ionization density. Their biological effects are similar to those of β-particles.  Since a neutron has a mass almost equal to that of a proton, a neutron beam stops efficiently when colliding with a proton. Since the human body contains a large amount of water, neutrons lose their energy as they collide with hydrogen nuclei (protons) that make up water molecules.

      <h3>UV Radiation</h3>
      <p>
        Taking steps to protect yourself from the sun is a year-round responsibility. Protect yourself and others from the sun with shade, a shirt, or sunblock (SPF 15+) all year long.

        Ultraviolet (UV) radiation is a form of non-ionizing radiation that is emitted by the sun and artificial sources, such as tanning beds. While it has some benefits for people, including the creation of Vitamin D, it also can cause health risks.
        
        Our natural source of UV radiation:
        The sun
        Some artificial sources of UV radiation include:
        Tanning beds
        Mercury vapor lighting (often found in stadiums and school gyms)
        Some halogen, fluorescent, and incandescent lights
        Some types of lasers
        Types of UV Radiation Rays
        UV radiation is classified into three primary types: ultraviolet A (UVA), ultraviolet B (UVB), and ultraviolet C (UVC), based on their wavelengths. Almost all the UV radiation that reaches earth is UVA though some UVB radiation reaches earth. UVA and UVB radiation can both affect health, but UVA penetrates deeper into the skin and is more constant throughout the year.
        
        Wave Type	UVA	UVB	UVC
        Wavelength*	315- 399 nm	280-314 nm	100-279 nm
        Absorption Level	Not absorbed by the ozone layer	Mostly absorbed by the ozone layer, but some does reach the Earth’s surface	Completely absorbed by the ozone layer and atmosphere
        *nm= 0.000000001 meters or 1×10-9 meters
        
        Benefits
        The production of vitamin D, a vitamin essential to human health.
        Vitamin D helps the body absorb calcium and phosphorus from food and assists bone development. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends 5 to 15 minutes of sun exposure 2 to 3 times a week.
        
        Risks
        Child wearing a brimmed hat and sunglasses has sunscreen applied to her face.
        Sunscreen and sunglasses can be used to protect you from UV radiation.
        Sunburn is a sign of short-term overexposure, while premature aging and skin cancer are side effects of prolonged UV exposure.
        UV exposure increases the risk of potentially blinding eye diseases if eye protection is not used.
        Overexposure to UV radiation can lead to serious health issues, including cancer.
        Skin cancer is the most common cancer in the United States. The two most common types of skin cancer are basal cell cancer and squamous cell cancer. Typically, they form on the head, face, neck, hands, and arms because these body parts are the most exposed to UV radiation. Most cases of melanoma, the deadliest kind of skin cancer, are caused by exposure to UV radiation.
        
        Anyone can have harmful health effects from UV radiation, but the risks increase in people who:
        
        Spend a lot of time in the sun or have been sunburned.
        Have light-color skin, hair, and eyes.
        Take some types of oral and topical medicines, such as antibiotics, birth control pills, and benzoyl peroxide products, as well as some cosmetics, may increase skin and eye sensitivity to UV in all skin types.
        Have a family member with skin cancer.
        Are over age 50.
        To protect yourself from UV radiation
        Stay in the shade, especially during midday hours.
        Wear clothes that cover your arms and legs.
        Consider options to protect your children.
        Wear a wide brim hat to shade your face, head, ears, and neck.
        Wear wraparound sunglasses that block both UVA and UVB rays.
        Use sunscreen with sun protection factor (SPF) 15 or higher, for both UVA and UVB protection.
        Avoid indoor tanning. Indoor tanning is particularly dangerous for younger users; people who begin indoor tanning during adolescence or early adulthood have a higher risk of developing melanoma.
