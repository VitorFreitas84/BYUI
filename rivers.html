The two branches of Provo are split into upper, middle, and lower sections. The upper Provo originates in the high Uintas and flows into Jordanelle Reservoir. Below the dam of Jordanelle to Deer Creek Reservoir is known as the Middle Provo river. The Middle Provo is joined on the right by Snake Creek, which includes the Midway Fish Hatchery. The lower section of the Provo river flows out of Deer creek Reservoir through Provo Canyon and into Utah lake.</p>

                <p>
                  The Yampa River flows 250 miles (400 km) through northwestern Colorado, United States. Rising in t""e" Rocky Mountains, it is a tributary of the Green River and a major part of the Colorado River system. The Yampa is one of the few free-flowing rivers in the western United States, with only a few small dams and diversions.

                  The name is derived from the Snake Indians word for the Perideridia plant, which has an edible root. John C. Frémont was among the first to record the name 'Yampah' in entries of his journal from 1843, as he found the plant was particularly abundant in the watershed.
