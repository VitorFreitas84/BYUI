        <p>Medical Physics is the branch of Physics that comprises the application of concepts, laws, models, agents and methods of Physics for the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of diseases, playing an important role in medical care, biomedical research and optimization of protection radiology.</p>
        <p>Currently, Medical Physics applies the physical foundations of multiple therapeutic techniques, provides the scientific basis for the understanding and development of modern technologies that have revolutionized medical diagnosis and establishes the criteria for the correct use of physical agents used in Medicine.</p>
        <p>Finally, it establishes, in collaboration with Bioengineering, the necessary bases for measuring biomedical variables and provides, together with biophysics, the necessary foundations for the development of models that explain the functioning of the human body.</p>
        <p>The most important development of Medical Physics, as we currently understand it, took place with the discovery of x-rays and radioactivity, given their decisive impact on modern medical diagnosis and therapy. These discoveries mark a historical hiatus in the application of physical agents in Medicine, providing revolutionary methods of diagnosing and treating diseases. In coherence with this reality, the need to incorporate Physics professionals in large hospitals and clinics around the world has developed.</p>
        <p>Medical Physics, therefore, is developed mainly in the areas of Diagnostic and Interventional Radiology, Nuclear Medicine, Radiotherapy, Radiosurgery, Radiological Protection, Metrology of Ionizing Radiations, Biomagnetism and Clinical and epidemiological Radiobiology. Medical Physics professionals are essential in the use of cutting-edge technologies such as clinical linear accelerators, gamma tomographs, high dose rate brachytherapy systems, magnetic resonance tomographs, as well as in ensuring the quality of health services provided to society.</p>

        <p>For this reason, in addition to Medicine and Physics, it is necessary to master everything that has to do with exact sciences. Mathematics, IT and Chemistry will be essential points for developing good work.
